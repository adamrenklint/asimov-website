text:

- I will create content in a <strong>semantic structure</strong> (folders and textfiles using simple and <strong>expressive syntax</strong> (YAML, Markdown, Handlebars) and <strong>compose pages</strong> from inherited and original resources.

- I will write my rich frontend clients in <strong>small chunks</strong>, assembled by <strong>multiple sandboxed applications</strong> and <strong>isolated single purpose modules</strong>, powered by an extensive framework of utilities.

- I will <strong>extend and alter</strong> the smart default behavior of every aspect and event of the asimov.js process, using environment configurations, <strong>custom initializers</strong> and <strong>request middleware</strong>, custom for your project or <strong>bundled in themes and plugins</strong>.
