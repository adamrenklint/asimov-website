text:

- We create <strong>dynamic, rich content</strong> using a <strong>semantic structure</strong> (folders and textfiles) together with <strong>simple and expressive syntax</strong> (YAML, Markdown, Handlebars).

- We write frontend clients in <strong>small chunks</strong>, assembled by multiple <strong>sandboxed applications</strong> and <strong>isolated single purpose modules</strong>, powered by an extensive MVVC framwork.

- We will <strong>extend and alter</strong> the smart default behaviors of every aspect and lifecycle event of the asimov.js process, using <strong>environment configurations</strong>, <strong>custom initializers</strong>, <strong>request middleware</strong>, bundled in <strong>themes</strong> and <strong>plugins</strong>.
