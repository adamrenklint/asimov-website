text:

- I will create content in a semantic structure (folders and textfiles) using simple and expressive syntax (YAML, Markdown, Handlebars) and compose pages from inherited and original resources.

- I will write my application in small chunks, composed of single purposed modules, powered by an extensive server and client side framework.

- I can extend and alter the behavior of every aspect and event of the asimov process, using custom initializers and request middleware, themes and plugins.
