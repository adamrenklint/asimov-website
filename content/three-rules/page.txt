text:

- Create <strong>dynamic, rich content</strong> using a <strong>familiar, semantic structure</strong> (folders and textfiles) together with <strong>simple and expressive syntax</strong> (YAML, Markdown, Handlebars).

- Write frontend clients in <strong>small chunks</strong>, assembled by multiple <strong>sandboxed applications</strong> and <strong>isolated single purpose modules</strong>, powered by an extensive MVVC framwork.

- Modify and extend the smart default behaviors of every aspect and lifecycle event of the asimov.js process, using <strong>environment configurations</strong>, <strong>custom initializers</strong>, <strong>request middleware</strong>, bundled in <strong>themes</strong> and <strong>plugins</strong>.
