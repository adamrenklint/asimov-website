text:

- I will create content in a <strong>semantic structure)</strong> (folders and textfiles using simple and <strong>expressive syntax</strong> (YAML, Markdown, Handlebars) and <strong>compose pages</strong> from inherited and original resources.

- I will write my rich frontend clients in <strong>small chunks</strong>, assembled by <strong>multiple sandboxed applications</strong> and <strong>isolated single purpose modules</strong>, powered by an extensive framework of utilities.

- I can extend and alter the behavior of every aspect and event of the asimov process, using environment configurations, custom initializers and request middleware, themes and plugins.
