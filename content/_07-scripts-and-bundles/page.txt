title: Scripts and bundles (WIP)
---
text:

{{script name}}

{{bundle name}}
{{bundle name data}}
{{bundle name data key="value"}}

choice of what to use or how to build your frontend application is free and up to you. it's a design goal for asimov.js to offer a port of the robust client framework that powers wunderlist.com, in a future version.


# old

embedding application bundles, application helper
one or many applications on a page
automatic reload

## Elements of a frontend application bundle

Application, Router, AppView, common classes and components

what is available for free from the framework
links to app examples?

maybe this page needs to be fleshed out to several pages,
don't want to be skipping on the docs for this very important part!!!
