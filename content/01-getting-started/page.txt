First off, congratulations to a great decision in installing asimov.js! Getting your own project up and running is only a few minutes away.

## Install the command line interface

First, make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Then, run this in the terminal to install the command line interface.

    $ npm install -g asimov-cli

## Create a new project and install dependencies

Creating a new project literally takes one second.

    $ asimov create myAwesomeProject
    $ cd myAwesomeProject
    $ npm install

## Launch server application
