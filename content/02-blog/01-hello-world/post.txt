First post, a lot to cover. Welcome! I'm [Adam](http://adamrenklint.com).

The past few months I've been working on a small project called [asimov.js](https://www.npmjs.org/package/asimov.js), a tool to help build websites and apps, using javascript and textfiles.

It features a simple and expressive syntax for creating content and layouts, simple folder structures for urls and sorting, a fast live-reloading development server and an even faster, clustered production server, built to handle massive amounts of requests.

Textfiles in the ```/content``` folder are parsed and compiled to static pages, served by a cluster of high-performance static server workers.

## Background?

First of all, I'm a javascript developer. In the last years, I've sometimes been working with [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com), a simple and competent PHP framework for building websites. It's been a great tool, so I decided to apply the best parts of it to javascript and node.js.

There are lots of projects that aim to solve the same problem, in different or similar ways, on many different platforms. This is one take on it, and I think it makes a lot of sense.

It's built to fit a certain need, based on what I've experienced in the past few years, building websites and apps like [Wunderlist](http://www.wunderlist.com) for [6Wunderkinder](http://www.6wunderkinder.com). I hope to see it also evolve with the community that uses it, however big or small it may be.

If you are in need of a performant javascript powered website and app server, give it a try!

## First things first

Assuming you already have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed, you need the command line interface.

```
$ npm install -g asimov.js
```

This gives you a exectable called ```ajs```, which let's you create new projects and pages, run tests and start your project. So let's create a blank project.

```
$ ajs create myAwesomeProject
```

This creates a new project from a [template](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimovjs-template-project). Let's have a look.

```
$ cd myAwesomeProject
$ ajs --open
```

This will start your project, compile all the pages and open **http://127.0.0.1:3003** in your default browser.

## Learn how it works

If you are totally new to asimov.js, start with {{link "/docs/getting-started" "the basics"}}.

To learn more about what the CLI can do for you, check out {{link "/docs/commands" "Commands"}}.

Or if you want to dive right into creating creating content and designing pages, start with {{link "/docs/pages-and-urls" "Pages and Urls"}} and follow with {{link "/docs/templates-and-helper" "Templates and Helpers"}}.

If you want to keep up to date with all the new stuff in every version of asimov.js, keep checking out the {{link "/docs/changelog" "changelog"}} and {{link "/blog" "blog"}}.

## Open source

The project is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/blob/master/LICENSE) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js). Bugs and feature requests can be posted on [Github Issues](https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js/issues), and pull requests are of course more than welcome.

## What's next

In the next few releases you will get a powerful plugin and theme engine, and plugins to support asimov.js projects running in production. And **more and better docs**.

Please reach out with feedback, ideas or constructive criticism.

Thank you for your time.
