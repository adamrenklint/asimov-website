Observation is the action & process of observing something or someone carefully in order to gain new information. It is the action behind taking notice of a specific event and understanding the reason behind the event. It is fundamental to learning.

Imagine being completely unobservant about the world around you? You would probably be completely lost, dazed out and confused most of the time. Your ability to interact with people would be based on what you have learnt from secondary knowledge. You would be utterly “clueless”.

But the truth is that very few people are actually fully observant of their environment and the people around them. As James Altucher puts it “most people live either in the past or future” not taking much account for the present which is where all of our observation is done. I have come to believe that great observers focus on the present, since its the only time you can actually be aware of the things happening around you.

Being observant is a natural human instinct that helps us constantly improve, become more competitive in our environment and simultaneously become more emphatic towards others, its a trait that has been embedded into the human psyche for a massively long time but has become jarred in our modern society. So, how does one become more observant?
