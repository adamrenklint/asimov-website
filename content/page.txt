Title: A simple web framework for awesome websites and apps
---
text:

▲ asimov.js mainly offers three things: a simple structure and workflow for creating content, a client side single page app framework with lots of convention and shortcuts, and a backend that takes care of mapping dependencies, generating minified resources and serving requests.

###It is actually as simple as that.

An ▲ asimov.js application has several different types of components, each with its clear purpose. When the app bootstrap <code>main.js</code> is executed, the **server application** starts. You add content by creating **folders and textfiles**, and use handlebars **templates** together with template **helpers** to render pages. Client side **application bundles** are automatically compressed, included on the page and served to the browser, same goes for stylus **stylesheets**. Create custom server **initializers** and **middleware** to change the backends behavior.

what problem does asimov solve for you?
how does it solve it?
