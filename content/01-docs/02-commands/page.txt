text:

asimov.js comes with a command line interface, called <code>ajs</code>, that allows you to create projects, manage pages, run your tests and much more, from your terminal.

Following the base principle of asimov.js, all core commands are built as plugins, and developers can easily add custom commands, or even overload existing ones.
