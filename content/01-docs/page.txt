Welcome, young padawan. Here you will learn the basics of what asimov.js is and does, how to interact with all the moving parts, and how to bend and extend the lifecycle events of your app.

If you are totally new to asimov.js, start with {{link "/docs/getting-started" "the basics"}}.

If you want to keep up to date with all the new stuff in every version of asimov.js, keep checking out the {{link "/docs/changelog" "changelog"}} and {{link "/blog" "blog"}}.

A successful tool and open source project needs good and focused documentation. If you have any feedback or critique, please {{email "adam@renklint.com" title="reach out"}}.

If you are a developer and looking to contribute, {{link "https://github.com/adamrenklint/asimov.js" "fork the repo"}}.
