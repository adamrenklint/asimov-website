title: Importing data from other pages

## This is the wrong way of doing it... just make a page helper that returns the page and it's values...






You can import data from any other page in your content folder, and re-use their values. Simply define a parent and access its attributes with the ```super``` variable.

```
%divider%
inherits: /blog/hello-world
%divider%
text: Once I said %cl%super.text%cr%
%divider%
```

If the parent page defines nested data structures with YAML, you can get those too.

```
%divider%
inherits: /contact
%divider%
text: We're located in %cl%super.adress.city%cr%
%divider%
```
