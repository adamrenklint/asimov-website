text:

Pages are simple textfiles, saved in the <code>/content</code> folder. Their urls are defined by the folder structure, and the name of the textfile defines what template is used to render it.

## Format of a page textfile

```
title: My awesome page!
%divider%
tags: [epic, legendary]
%divider%
text: Hello world!
```

A page textfile consists of **content sections**, divided by three dashes, defining a key and some sort of value.

### Plain text

```
%divider%
title: My awesome page!
%divider%
text: I am the main content!
%divider%
```

### Markdown

Pretty obvious, this one. [The one and only Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

### Handlebars

[Templates](/docs/templates-and-helpers) are based on Handlebars, but you can also use its syntax directly in page textfiles. To learn more about what variables are available, jump to [Objects and Variables](/docs/objects-and-variables).

```
%divider%
title: My awesome page!
%divider%
text: I said, this is %cl%page.title%cr%
%divider%
```

### List (array of strings)

```
%divider%
tags: [epic, legendary]
%divider%
```

The *tag* section will be parsed to an array of strings.

### YAML

Use nested data structures to avoid repetition.

```
title: A page of links
%divider%
links:
  adamrenklint:
    type: developer
    url: http://adamrenklint.com
%divider%
text: Visit the %cl%link links.adamrenklint.url links.adamrenklint.type%cr%
```

### HTML

Yeah, you read it. Good olâ€² HTML also works in page text files, to allow for truly flexible, page specific designs and layouts.

## Creating a new page

You can use the [```ajs new page [url] [template]```](/docs/commands/default-commands) command to create a new page. In this example, we'll create a page at ```/content/about-me/page.txt```, that uses the ```/site/templates/page.tmpl``` to render.

```
$ ajs new page about-me page
> Created new page @ /content/about-me/page.txt
```

You can of course also just create folders and textfiles from your favourite texteditor, whatever floats your boat.
